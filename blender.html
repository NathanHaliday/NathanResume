        <h1>My Best Blender Project</h1>
        <p>Blender is a free and open-source 3D graphics software tool, and is used for creating animated films, art, 3D-printed models, and video games. I have over 400 hours of experience in Blender and I am still learning new things every day. I hope to learn more about rigging and animation in the future. Here is the project I am most proud of.

                <p>This project showcases my ability to create realistic 3D models and textures. I put great detail into every aspect of the project, from the lighting to the materials, and rendering to achieve a professional and finished look. The scene includes a hexagonal desk of my own design inside a small office style building, a beautiful river scenery surrounding the building, and a character model I tweaked and rigged.

                <h2>The landscape</h2>
                <p>The landscape surrounding the building is a beautiful river scenery, with a river flowing through and trees and grasses lining the banks. I used custom trees with hexagonal leaves as a small easter egg to my desk design. My landscape is made up entirely of 8K textures to ensure the highest quality possible. I also have a
